# The Five Species Of Counterpoint

In counterpoint, there are five species of counterpoint that you can learn which are:

-   First species
-   Second species
-   Third species
-   Fourth species
-   Fifth species

Think of the species like levels, so First Species counterpoint is the easiest, and they get gradually harder and harder
up to Fifth Species.

In all species counterpoint, there is a cantus firmus that is notated in semibreves (whole notes).

This melody could be four, six, eight bars long or longer, and is usually very simple.

The cantus firmus is then used as the basis for composing the counterpoint melody. Here’s an example: Basic Rules for
All Species

There are a number of rules that apply to all five species of counterpoint.

Some rules are applied to both melodies, the cantus firmus and the counterpoint melody, and some rules are applied only
to the combination of the two melodies and the harmonies they create.

Some of those that apply to each part are:

-   The final note must be approached by step. In a minor key, if the final is approached from below, then the leading
    tone must be raised (e.g. C to C# in D minor).
-   The melody can be made up of specific intervals: major and minor 2nds and 3rds, perfect 4ths, 5ths, and octaves, and
    the ascending minor 6th (which must then be followed by motion downwards).
-   Generally, do not write more than one skip at a time in the same direction. If it is done, the second skip must be
    smaller than the first, and the first and third note cannot be dissonant to each other.
-   If you have a skip in one direction, it should be followed by motion in the opposite direction.
-   There must be a climax (high point) in the counterpoint melody line. This should occur somewhere in the middle of
    the melody on a strong beat.

Rules that apply to the combination of the parts:

-   The piece must begin and end on a perfect consonance.
-   Contrary motion should be used as often as possible.
-   Perfect consonances (4th, 5th, or octave) must be approached by oblique or contrary motion.
-   Imperfect consonances (3rd or 6th) may be approached by any type of motion.
-   One melody line should not be more than a 10th (an octave + a 3rd) above the other.

Contrary motion is where the voices move it opposite directions. This is the type of motion you should use the most.

Direct motion is where the voices move by the same interval in the same direction.

Oblique motion is where one voice stays the same and the other moves.

## Rules for writing your own cantus firmus

Something to keep in mind when working on any aspect of counterpoint is that this is music that originated from singing
and was codified with the voice in mind. This means that certain rules were born because counterpoint began as vocal
music rather than instrumental.

-   Avoid exceeding the range of an octave.
-   Avoid outlining a tritone, minor 7th, or major 7th.
-   Avoid having to much motion going up or down. A good rule of thumb is to not have more than four notes moving in the
    same direction.
-   Do not leap to a tritone, minor 7th, major 7th, or any interval greater than an octave.
-   Should have only one note that is the highest pitch (do not repeat the highest pitch). This is the climax.
-   Should move predominately by stepwise motion. Avoid more than two leaps in a row.

## First Species Counterpoint

In First Species counterpoint, you have one note against one note.

Therefore, with a semibreve cantus firmus, you have semibreves in the counterpoint melody.

In addition to the list of rules above, there are a few more rules specifically for First Species counterpoint:

-   The counterpoint must begin and end on an interval of either unison, octave, or fifth, and usually only unison or
    octave.
-   You cannot use unison intervals (the same note in both melodies at the same time) except at the beginning or end.
-   Do not move both parts in parallel 4ths, 5ths, or octaves.
-   Avoid “hidden” parallel 4ths, 5ths, and octaves, which is movement by similar motion to a perfect 4th, 5th, or
    octave, unless one of the parts moves by step.
-   You cannot use any interval more than three times in a row.
-   Try to use multiple parallel thirds or sixths in a row (though only up to three, as stated in rule 5).
-   Do not move both parts in the same direction by skip.
-   Avoid dissonant intervals 2nds, 7ths, augmented or diminished intervals, and (often) perfect 4ths.

-   Only use consonant intervals but strive to use more imperfect intervals than perfect.
-   Strive to use more contrary motion than direct or oblique.
-   perfect intervals can move to another perfect by contrary or oblique (not direct)
-   perfect intervals can move to imperfect by any motion.
-   Imperfect intervals can move to perfect by contrary or oblique (not direct)
-   Imperfect intervals can move to imperfect by any motion.
-   Do not let the interval between the voices exceed a major 10th.
-   Try to limit voice crossings.
-   Do not leap by a major 6th or dissonant intervals.
-   Do not leap into an octave or unison even in contrary motion.
-   Do not leap by an interval greater than an octave.
-   Do not outline a tritone.
-   Avoid repetitions.

## Second Species Counterpoint

Second Species counterpoint is similar to first species, except that the counterpoint melody line has double the amount
of notes.

If the cantus firmus is notated with semibreves, then the counterpoint line is notated with minims (or half notes).

A few additional rules (or relaxations of previous rules) are added for second species counterpoint as well.

-   You can begin on an upbeat, leaving a half-rest at the start of the counterpoint voice.
-   The accented beat (first minim in each bar) must only have consonant intervals (3rds, perfect 4ths and 5ths, or
    6ths). The second minim beat may have dissonance, but only as a passing tone, and it must be approached and left by
    step.
-   Unison, while still avoided, may occur on the unaccented part of the bar.
-   You cannot have successive accented perfect 5ths or octaves.

rom now on, I’ll be referring to the intervals and motion that was introduced in 1st species. The biggest changes are
the use of two notes in the counterpoint for every note in the cantus firmus and the inclusion of dissonant intervals.

-   The downbeat is always consonant.
-   The upbeat (the second half of the measure) may be consonant.
-   If the upbeat is dissonant, the notes before and after must be approached and left by stepwise motion. This will
    result in either neighbor tones or passing tones.
-   If the weak beat (upbeat) moves by skip, the interval must be consonant.
-   If the cantus firmus is in the lower voice, then the final two measures must have the following interval sequence:
    P5 — M6 — P8.
-   If the cantus firmus is in the upper voice, then the final two measures must have the following interval sequence:
    P5 — m3 — P1.
-   Do not write a series of measures where the downbeats are P5, P8, or P1.
-   Don’t separate the voices by more than a 10th.
-   Be careful with voice crossings (allowed but don’t do it too often).
-   Prefer contrary motion over direct or oblique.
-   No dissonant leaps.
-   No leaps larger than an octave.

## Third Species Counterpoint

Third Species counterpoint is when you have four counterpoint notes against one cantus firmus note.

So if the cantus firmus is composed of semibreves, then the counterpoint voice is composed of crotchets (or quarter
notes).

This species is more flexible than the previous two, and allows for two dissonant passing tones in a row, although the
first beats of each bar must always be consonant.

The species of counterpoint is now four notes in the counterpoint against one note in the cantus firmus. Most of the
same rules from the previous species of counterpoint should be observed.

-   Start with a consonance.
-   If five quarter notes are going up or going down the following rules apply: The 1st note must be consonant. The 2nd
    note can be dissonant or consonant. The 3rd note must be consonant unless all the other beats in the 5-note series
    are consonant. The 4th note can be dissonant if the 5th note is consonant.
-   You can leap away from a dissonance if you then resolve it in the opposite direction by step. This is called
    “cambiata”.
-   The next to last measure: If the cantus firmus is in the lower part, then the 2nd to last interval must be a major
    6th that then moves by contrary motion to the octave. If the cantus firmus is in the upper part, then the 2nd to
    last interval must be a minor 3rd that resolves to a unison (can also be a minor 10th to an octave).
-   It’s suggested to continue to use more contrary motion.
-   It’s suggested to try not to write “too many” notes going in the same direction. How many is too many? Fux wrote up
    to nine notes going in the same direction, but use your ear.

## Fourth Species Counterpoint

In Fourth Species counterpoint, you have notes that are “tied” over the bar line, creating “suspensions” of the
counterpoint voice over the cantus firmus voice.

This means the first beat of the bar (the accented beat) often has a dissonant interval, which is then made consonant by
the next note, on the unaccented beat.

This species changes things up rhythmically by tying half notes over the bar line.

-   The first measure of the counterpoint begins with a half rest.
-   The upbeat (2nd half of the measure) must be consonant.
-   The downbeat (1st half of the measure) can be consonant or dissonant.
-   Dissonant intervals are resolved by moving down by stepwise motion to a consonant interval.
-   When a ligature (tied note) is not possible, you can write a couple of half notes to get out of the situation.
-   Be careful to avoid repetitions.
-   The 2nd to last measure: If the cantus firmus is in the lower voice, you should have a 7th resolve to a 6th that
    then moves to the final interval of an octave. If the cantus firmus is in the upper voice, you should have a 2nd
    resolve to a 3rd that then moves to the final interval of a unison.

## Fifth Species Counterpoint

In Fifth Species counterpoint, you can combine the rules and structures of the previous four species, so you can have
suspended notes, minims, crotchets, and semibreves.

This species can also be called “florid counterpoint” because you are free to use a combination of any of the previous
species. At this point you are getting a lot closer to actual composition. In this species Fux says, you are looking for
melodic lines with liveliness of movement, and beauty and variety of form.

There are no specific rules to this counterpoint that are different than the rules already explained in the previous
species. This is simply where you put them all together! Something to keep in mind though is that the counterpoint
should always be viewed through the lens of a vocal melody – it should be singable.
