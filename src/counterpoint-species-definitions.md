# The Five Species Of Counterpoint

In counterpoint, there are five species of counterpoint that you can learn which are:

-   First species
-   Second species
-   Third species
-   Fourth species
-   Fifth species

Think of the species like levels, so First Species counterpoint is the easiest, and they get gradually harder and harder
up to Fifth Species.

In all species counterpoint, there is a cantus firmus that is notated in semibreves (whole notes).

This melody could be four, six, eight bars long or longer, and is usually very simple.

The cantus firmus is then used as the basis for composing the counterpoint melody. Here’s an example: Basic Rules for
All Species

There are a number of rules that apply to all five species of counterpoint.

Some rules are applied to both melodies, the cantus firmus and the counterpoint melody, and some rules are applied only
to the combination of the two melodies and the harmonies they create.

Some of those that apply to each part are:

-   The final note must be approached by step. In a minor key, if the final is approached from below, then the leading
    tone must be raised (e.g. C to C# in D minor).
-   The melody can be made up of specific intervals: major and minor 2nds and 3rds, perfect 4ths, 5ths, and octaves, and
    the ascending minor 6th (which must then be followed by motion downwards).
-   Generally, do not write more than one skip at a time in the same direction. If it is done, the second skip must be
    smaller than the first, and the first and third note cannot be dissonant to each other.
-   If you have a skip in one direction, it should be followed by motion in the opposite direction.
-   There must be a climax (high point) in the counterpoint melody line. This should occur somewhere in the middle of
    the melody on a strong beat.

Rules that apply to the combination of the parts:

-   The piece must begin and end on a perfect consonance.
-   Contrary motion should be used as often as possible.
-   Perfect consonances (4th, 5th, or octave) must be approached by oblique or contrary motion.
-   Imperfect consonances (3rd or 6th) may be approached by any type of motion.
-   One melody line should not be more than a 10th (an octave + a 3rd) above the other.

## Rules for writing your own cantus firmus

Something to keep in mind when working on any aspect of counterpoint is that this is music that originated from singing
and was codified with the voice in mind. This means that certain rules were born because counterpoint began as vocal
music rather than instrumental.

-   Avoid exceeding the range of an octave.
-   Avoid outlining a tritone, minor 7th, or major 7th.
-   Avoid having to much motion going up or down. A good rule of thumb is to not have more than four notes moving in the
    same direction.
-   Do not leap to a tritone, minor 7th, major 7th, or any interval greater than an octave.
-   Should have only one note that is the highest pitch (do not repeat the highest pitch). This is the climax.
-   Should move predominately by stepwise motion. Avoid more than two leaps in a row.

## First Species Counterpoint

In First Species counterpoint, you have one note against one note.

Therefore, with a semibreve cantus firmus, you have semibreves in the counterpoint melody.

In addition to the list of rules above, there are a few more rules specifically for First Species counterpoint:

-   The counterpoint must begin and end on an interval of either unison, octave, or fifth, and usually only unison or
    octave.
-   You cannot use unison intervals (the same note in both melodies at the same time) except at the beginning or end.
-   Do not move both parts in parallel 4ths, 5ths, or octaves.
-   Avoid “hidden” parallel 4ths, 5ths, and octaves, which is movement by similar motion to a perfect 4th, 5th, or
    octave, unless one of the parts moves by step.
-   You cannot use any interval more than three times in a row.
-   Try to use multiple parallel thirds or sixths in a row (though only up to three, as stated in rule 5).
-   Do not move both parts in the same direction by skip.
-   Avoid dissonant intervals 2nds, 7ths, augmented or diminished intervals, and (often) perfect 4ths.

## Second Species Counterpoint

Second Species counterpoint is similar to first species, except that the counterpoint melody line has double the amount
of notes.

If the cantus firmus is notated with semibreves, then the counterpoint line is notated with minims (or half notes).

A few additional rules (or relaxations of previous rules) are added for second species counterpoint as well.

-   You can begin on an upbeat, leaving a half-rest at the start of the counterpoint voice.
-   The accented beat (first minim in each bar) must only have consonant intervals (3rds, perfect 4ths and 5ths, or
    6ths). The second minim beat may have dissonance, but only as a passing tone, and it must be approached and left by
    step.
-   Unison, while still avoided, may occur on the unaccented part of the bar.
-   You cannot have successive accented perfect 5ths or octaves.

## Third Species Counterpoint

Third Species counterpoint is when you have four counterpoint notes against one cantus firmus note.

So if the cantus firmus is composed of semibreves, then the counterpoint voice is composed of crotchets (or quarter
notes).

This species is more flexible than the previous two, and allows for two dissonant passing tones in a row, although the
first beats of each bar must always be consonant.

## Fourth Species Counterpoint

In Fourth Species counterpoint, you have notes that are “tied” over the bar line, creating “suspensions” of the
counterpoint voice over the cantus firmus voice.

This means the first beat of the bar (the accented beat) often has a dissonant interval, which is then made consonant by
the next note, on the unaccented beat.

## Fifth Species Counterpoint

In Fifth Species counterpoint, you can combine the rules and structures of the previous four species, so you can have
suspended notes, minims, crotchets, and semibreves.
