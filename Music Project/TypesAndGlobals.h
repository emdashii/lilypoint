/*
 * Refer to the keyboard layout picture in non-coding related folder for the keyboard layout this was based off of
 * Basically each key is assigned a number corresponding to its position on an 88 key keyboard
 * This should make counting half steps very easy, just subtract the two notes from each other
 * and you got the number of half steps between them
